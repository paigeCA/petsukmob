    <p>Deliveries made by our courier are at a discounted rate and should you wish for us to re-send your parcel it will be done at the true cost to us. </p>
    <p>Responsibility cannot be taken for the wrong order, or non-delivery, resulting from incorrect information or addresses being provided. You may be responsible for the cost of delivery and the return of the goods in these circumstances. </p>
    <p>No Party shall be liable for any failure to perform its obligations where such failure is as a result of Acts of Nature (including fire, flood, earthquake, storm, hurricane or other natural disaster), war, invasion, act of foreign enemies, hostilities (whether war is declared or not), civil war, rebellion, revolution, insurrection, military or usurped power or confiscation, terrorist activities, nationalisation, government sanction, blockage, embargo, labour dispute, strike, lockout or interruption or failure of electricity [or telephone service], and no other Party will have a right to terminate this Agreement in such circumstances. </p>

    <p>In the unlikely event that your order should fail to arrive within our promised delivery period please email us with your order number and we will carry out a thorough investigation with our courier and endeavor to get your package delivered to you. Should you wish to cancel your order and it has been dispatched by us you will be liable for any cost incurred by us for the goods being returned back by our courier. If your order has failed to arrive within 15 working days from the date of dispatching your order it is deemed by us as lost. Should you fail to report to us that your parcel has not arrived within this time and we have a signature of delivery from our courier we will be unable to claim for loss of the item from our courier and therefore unable to replace your goods. Should you refuse to sign for your package within this 15 day period you will be liable for any cost incurred by us for the goods being returned back.</p>

Should you fail to report to us that your parcel has not arrived within this time and we have a signature of delivery from our courier we will be unable to claim for loss of the item from our courier and therefore unable to replace your goods. Should you refuse to sign for your package within this 15 day period you will be liable for any cost incurred by us for the goods being returned back. In the very unlikely event that your order is "lost in the post", please contact us and we will, in conjunction with Royal Mail & DPD undertake a thorough investigation as to how and why the item has been lost. Once we are able to establish that the item is definitely lost we will redeliver the goods, this may take up to 30 days from the date of posting. However should you wish us to dispatch your order again at once you will have to accept responsibility of the cost of this until your claim has been completed by our courier. We will not charge your card until all investigations have been completed and any failure to cooperate with us or our courier during this investigation could jeopardize your claim for loss. Should your missing order arrive and you fail to inform us within 7 days of delivery to you then you will be liable for the cost of both the original and replacement order. On placing an order with Pets UK should you request the parcel to be left without a signature (i.e. Garage, back garden etc) you shall be liable should the parcel not be received. Pets UK cannot take any responsibility should the order not be received, when you request a delivery without a signature, we always recommend that a signature is obtained. Parcels are left without a signature at the discretion of the driver. We cannot be held liable for any loss including consequential loss if a product does not arrive on time. </p>
